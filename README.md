# CVE-2019-9053
Improved code of Daniele Scanu SQL Injection exploit

Following changes applied:
- Added time control variable -t or --time that enables user to extend the timing of SQL injection (useful if a network connection in between hosts is subject of delays with packet transmission)
- Network exception handling added: to retry in case of a packet/connection/response lost (originally Python would throw an exception and You'd have to start over again)
- In case of getting hash/salt there is no need to use a full dictionary, as it is represended in hex, so alternate shorten dictionary is used [0123456789abcdef] to speed up the code
- Python3 required that hashlib.md5() arguments are to be encoded, so a hash finding function has been re-written accordingly

Enjoy!
